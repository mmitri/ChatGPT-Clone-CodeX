# ChatGPT-Clone-CodeX

This is a small coding project that I followed from a video by JsMastery on Youtube.
It is a ChatGPT clone. It has both a client and server side, written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
If you would like to visit my frontend and use the chat service, you can visit this link: https://chat-gpt-clone-code-x.vercel.app/
The Front end is run on Vercel.com. The backend is run on Render.com.
